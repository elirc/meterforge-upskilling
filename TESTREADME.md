# Testing guide: from junior habits to mid-level judgment

MeterForge adds tests because billing failures hide at boundaries: one duplicated usage event, one unit counted twice, a cross-tenant lookup, an invoice changed after issue, two concurrent writers, or a retry with a new identity. A useful test names the risk and proves a guarantee another engineer can safely change around.

The goal is not 100% coverage. The goal is deterministic evidence that fails for the right reason.

## Test portfolio

| Layer | Protects | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | dense rules without I/O | money, dates, tiers, state transitions, credits, refunds |
| Application | orchestration and port guarantees | tenant-scoped replay, expected versions, snapshots, provider calls |
| API | public compatibility and wiring | JSON, status codes, Problem Details, headers, health, OpenAPI |
| Architecture | a few costly dependency rules | framework-free domain and inward dependencies |

## How to add a test

1. State the risk: “What could be wrong even though this compiles?”
2. Choose the lowest layer that owns the answer.
3. Name behavior and outcome, such as `Rate_QuantityCrossingBoundary_ChargesEachUnitOnce`.
4. Arrange only meaningful facts with fixed dates, IDs, clocks, and provider results.
5. Make the counterexample fail before fixing a defect.
6. Assert observable state, value, error code, identity, or persisted evidence—not private methods.
7. Add a higher-level test only when routing, serialization, middleware, transactions, or provider wiring adds a distinct risk.
8. Refactor while green. A test that prevents internal restructuring without behavior change is too coupled.

## Lessons from the flaw harvest

- Tenant isolation needs a negative cross-tenant attempt; same-tenant success proves nothing about isolation.
- Tier arithmetic should assert conservation across boundaries, not only examples inside the first tier.
- Immutability needs a mutation attempt after finalization.
- Concurrency needs two writers against one version and an assertion that exactly one commits.
- Retry tests should compare stable identities before and after failure, not only the attempt counter.

## Common traps

- mocking every class and accidentally testing call choreography instead of behavior;
- copying the production algorithm into the expected-value calculation;
- depending on local time, test order, random values, delays, Docker, or live providers without isolating that dependency;
- repeating every domain permutation through slow HTTP tests;
- chasing coverage while important failures and boundaries remain untested;
- solving flakes with retries instead of fixing nondeterminism;
- accepting a snapshot diff without understanding the compatibility change.

## Commands

```powershell
dotnet restore MeterForge.slnx --locked-mode
dotnet test MeterForge.slnx --configuration Release
dotnet test tests/MeterForge.Domain.Tests --filter FullyQualifiedName~TieredRater
dotnet format MeterForge.slnx --verify-no-changes --no-restore
dotnet list MeterForge.slnx package --vulnerable --include-transitive
```

When CI fails, read the first meaningful failure, reproduce the focused project or class, and fix the owning boundary. Treat test code as maintained product code: clear reason, minimal setup, no hidden network, and useful failure output.

## Learning workspace checks

The [learning portal tests](tests/MeterForge.Api.Tests/Learning/LearningPortalTests.cs) protect the new entry route, static assets, embedded document catalog, plain-text responses, and rejection of paths outside that catalog. These tests exercise HTTP hosting; they do not prove browser persistence or keyboard behavior.

```powershell
python tools/check_docs.py
dotnet test tests/MeterForge.Api.Tests --filter FullyQualifiedName~LearningPortalTests
node --check src/MeterForge.Api/wwwroot/learn/app.js
```

The Python standard-library check validates local inline Markdown file/directory links, including paths with spaces. It ignores code fences, external URLs, and heading fragments. It runs in CI before the .NET checks. It is navigation evidence, not an assessment of the accuracy of a document's claims.

For interactive behavior, the optional [browser smoke check](tools/check_learning_portal.cjs) uses an existing Playwright installation and a running API. It checks the beginner starting stage, reasoning feedback without completion credit, practice evidence, search/stage filters, review progress, persistence after reload, old and new notebook export/import, invalid-backup rejection, every catalog document, related-guide navigation, document HTML handling, and mobile overflow. It uses an isolated browser context and mocks one response to test unsafe Markdown. See [portal maintenance](<astra docs/portal-maintenance.md>) for the reproducible command and dependency setup. These browser checks run separately from the .NET CI suite.
